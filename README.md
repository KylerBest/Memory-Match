# phase-1-project

This project will be a memory-match card game using https://deckofcardsapi.com.
Near the top of the page will be a couple of features:

1. A score counter - this will keep track of how many pairs of cards have been removed from the board.
2. A lives counter - initializes with a value of 3.

The player will click a card to show its value, and then a second card. If the second card's value is equal to the first's both cards are removed and the player gains a point. Otherwise, both cards flip back over and the player loses a life. If the player loses all three lives, the game is lost and the player is prompted to play again.
